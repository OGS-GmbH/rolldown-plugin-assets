- **File Emitting**\
  Emit individual static files directly into Rolldown's output directory during the build process.

- **Directory Support**\
  Recursively emit entire directories, preserving the original folder structure in the output.

- **Custom Output Paths**\
  Map source assets to different destination paths using simple [from, to] tuples for full control over your output.

- **Zero Configuration**\
  Pass a plain string path to emit an asset as-is — no extra setup required for the simple case.
